# standoffGameVectorized
Developed simple AI to play the game from https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-win-a-nuclear-standoff/

To run the AI, just go to the standoffBasicFunctions.R file and run the whole file. It will run a round of purely random 0:100 guesses, then it will use knn modeling to make predictions, then finally it will use linear modeling to make even better predictions faster.
